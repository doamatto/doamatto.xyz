**Hello and bienvenue! My name is Matt.**

I'm a high school student based in California who loves to make software to empower others to do amazing things.

Outside of software development, I also like doing graphic design, web development, and audio/video editing. I've been taking up an interest in homelabbing, Linux, iPods, and Formula racing.

## Business history

## Outside of "work" and work

In my free time, I like experimenting with hardware like Raspberry Pis and Arduinos. I have gain a large interest in Formula racing, with one of my favourite tracks being [Albert Park's circuit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Park_Circuit)

I love improving, and because of that, I've taken to learning things such as [the Workman layout](https://workmanlayout.org/) and penspinning. I've also been practicing with music creation and more as a very niche, super-duper side hobby.
