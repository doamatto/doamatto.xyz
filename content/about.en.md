## {{.Title}}

**Hello and bienvenue! My name is Matt.**

I'm a high school student who loves to make software to empower others to do amazing things.

Outside of software development, I also like doing graphic design, web development, and audio/video editing. I'm slowly (but surely) picking up 3D modeling and visual effects as well. I've been taking up an interest in homelabbing, Linux, iPods, and jailbreaking/rooting, as well.

## Business history

I'm currently working on contract as a web developer and game developer with [Glitch Entertainment](https://glitchbeta.doamatto.xyz). In the past, I've worked with the following companies:

- [Glitch Entertainment](https://playglitch.xyz) (2020-Present, Web Developer and Lead Online Developer)
- [Mello](https://github.com/mello-app) (2020-Present, Founder, Back-End/API Developer, Mental Research)
- [Pandemic Engineers](https://github.com/Pandemic-Engineers) (2020-2020)

## Outside of "work" and work

In my free time, I like experimenting with hardware like Raspberry Pis and Arduinos. I also like playing sports like [Ultimate](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)) and f√∫tbol.

I've been getting into photography most recently as I love to capture moments that can then last forever. I currently use Instagram to "host" my picture gallery, but plan to switch to something better orientated for photography in the future. [You can see some of the pictures I've took over time there.](https://www.instagram.com/thetruedoormat/)

## Miscellaneous

I've done some thesis papers and other research work over time. Some of the ones I'm most proud of and that are public are:

- A study for Mello (link coming as soon as the study is finished)
