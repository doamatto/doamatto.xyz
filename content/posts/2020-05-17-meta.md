Borderless Podcasts (a podcast publisher), Helios Hosting (a web hosting provider), and Rainbow Records (an indie record label) are all going to leave Electro Studios. The main reason for the leave is to enable these projects to be more independent. I've also been debating shutting down Electro and releasing all the partners. [You can join the "Project Triangle" Discord server (a name in the works) to keep supporting these projects, get updates on new ones of mine, and more.](https://discord.gg/jbcZg6C)
