5mLoading (which is "Another FiveM Loading Screen") is a clean loading screen for FiveM. It's delayed launch means a few features had to get held back to keep stability but ensure users could get straight to using it. Improvements such as notifications for updates and more are coming in the near future :). [You can learn more at the GitHub repo here.](https://github.com/doamatto/5m_loading)
