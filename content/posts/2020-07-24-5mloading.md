5mLoading version 0.2.0 is better than ever with new background options, faster music loading, and an overall better experience.
<!--more-->

5mLoading has evolved majorly since I started working on it, and even more since v0.1.0. With v0.2.0, there are two new awesome backgrounds: a rainbow gradient that fades through the colours and a new carousel. The carousel looks amazing and is preloaded with some gorgeous screenshots straight from FiveM (I had [NaturalVision](https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/naturalvision-photorealistic-gtav) installed).

Among the new themes, comes a lot of cool changes such as the gutting of jQuery, the fixes with the clock not having the right amount of zeroes, and a severe performance boost in the loading speed of Soundcloud (I measured about a second improvement over v0.1.0, but you're mileage may vary; caching was disabled).

Overall, it's a solid update and, with v0.3.0 planned for next month, a new loading bar and the estimated time until loaded feature seems to be right up there with what's to come.

You can install it today via [GitHub](https://github.com/doamatto/5m_loading/releases/tag/v0.2.0), as well as [check the source code too](https://github.com/doamatto/5m_loading/). If you like this loading screen, consider starring that repo and following me on GitHub to see the new and exiciting projects I work on over time.
