Hex Video, simply known as "Hex," has been delayed due to the coronavirus and lack of staff/volunteers. Hex Video has had its release date pushed back to 2021Q1 as a "best case scenario." It's hoped that the project can get back on its feet and kicking sooner, but only time will tell if others will help with the project or not. Hex, however, will not be cancelled and still will be worked on where possible.
