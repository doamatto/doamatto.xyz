PrivacySpy, a project maintained by [Miles McCain](https://miles.land/), [Igor Barakaiev](https://igor.fyi/), and [the Politiawtch team](https://politiwatch.org/), is like TOS;DR but for privacy policies. I decided to make a lot of contributions there and have put a list of said contributions that I'll keep updated [here](/privacyspy).
