I have this addiction, so to speak, of changing wallpapers. I love seeing something new everytime I turn on my tech. Wanting to give myself some new variety, I did up my first wallpaper pack: Nami.

Nami (which means "Waves") is a set of 10 different coloured and organic waves. Over almost a week now, I've been working on crafting these to be have great colours and a unique look.

I'm not one for asking for lots of money, even on something as simple as wallpapers. So, I told Gumroad that it would be a PWYO with a minimum of 1$ USD. This lets me still get a little something for my work, while still leaving it open to people who might buy the pack to spend whatever they feel it's worth.
